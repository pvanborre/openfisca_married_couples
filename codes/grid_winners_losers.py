# code reform that computes a primary tax burden that would be as if it was a single man (account for a single declaration)
# but how to allocate dependents ? we allocate them to one spouse only 
# counterfactual tax burden is an AVERAGE over two hypothetical tax burdens in which dependents are allocated to either one of the spouses.

# Daniel stata code 6D
# goal is to store a new column in data_pre['bonus'] = (data_pre['taux_marginal'] - TODO)/(data_pre['primary_earning'] + data_pre['secondary_earning'])

# compute info for these fake individuals : for the microsimulation model only need to change marital status for one, change marital status and set all dependents to 0 for the other 
# not that easy : better maybe to used dictionary form or at least look at the IRPP formula again on OF-France
# dico seems the best thing to do to separate individuals without dealing with id_foy etc 
# yes but as I considered at the beginning of the project it is not that easy though so ....
# other idea : do a reform where we change the formula for the IR
